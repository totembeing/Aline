-> Work-out sessions: 
	Work-out session will be an object 
	This work-out session object will have exercise objects 

-> Exercise objects: 
	Properties: name
	Each exercise object will have a set object 
	
-> Set objects: 
	properties: serial, weight,  repetitions 


Work-out session 
	->  Exercise 
		-> Set 

		
Example: 
			Push-Day work-out session 
				-> Incline dumbbell press
					-> Set 1 (50lbs, 5)
					-> Set 2 (50lbs, 8)
				-> Pec fly
					-> Set 1 (130lbs, 8)
					-> Set 2 (130lbs, 10)
					
			Pull-day work-out session
				-> Lat-pull down
					-> Set 1 (115lbs, 5)
					-> Set 2 (115lbs, 8) 
					
		
How the hierarchy will work: Work-out session object will have a list of exercise objects and exercise object 
	will have a list of set objects
